@Goal: To implement the Air Quality Index Application


This project is an Air Quality Application built using the Tkinter library in Python. 
It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for retrieving air quality information based on various input options such as 
zip code, longitude and latitude, or city name along with country.

The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time air quality data and display it in the GUI. Users can select their preferred input method,
enter the relevant details, and click the submit button to retrieve air quality information for the specified location. 

The application categorizes air quality levels into different categories such as Good, Fair, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, and Hazardous, 
providing users with valuable insights into the air quality of their desired location. 
Additionally, it features error handling to notify users of any input mistakes or invalid data entries. 
Overall, this Air Quality Application offers a convenient way for users to access and monitor air quality information effortlessly.
